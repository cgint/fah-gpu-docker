Here you find some collected docs that helped me get my system up and running. Mostly it helped me finding the tags that can be set in `config.xml`

- `command_help.md` is a dump of the command `docker run --rm foldingathome/fah-gpu:latest --help`
- `config_dist_example.xml` is the file that is distributed with the linux .deb-file
- `config_example_*.xml` are two configurations from the official [foldingathome/fah-gpu](https://hub.docker.com/r/foldingathome/fah-gpu)
